# 09-FPS

This is a rudimentary FPS game created for the class MSCH-G220 Game Technology as our Introduction to 3D Games. 

Here you will use a hand-modeled gun to defend yourself against the Ominous Shapes coming to attack you! Health and Ammo packs are availible for pickup should you need them, and and both a score, ammo, and healthbar will track your current stats.

Now as this is rudimentary and meant to be an Intro to 3D/FPS, some mechanics such as enemy respawn and player death are not present. This game piece is fully interactable, albeit rather weirdly as the cardinal compass is set about 90* clockwise instead of normal, but per instruction of the guide.

I was assisted through this project by Aeris Meadows and based on: https://godottutorials.pro/fps-godot-tutorial-part-1/. 

Enjoy?
